<p>At one time in the 90's, every Federal Agent in the entire country knew the name 'Jamie Romero.'
Widely acknowledged to be the nicest gangster in the history of organized crime, it was 
his personable way with people that allowed Mr. Romero to operate so long with impunity as 
the nation's premier bank robber.</p>  

<p>Like Clyde Barrow before him, the law eventually caught up with Jamie.  While incarcerated, 
Jamie researched a little-used codicil of Colorado State Law, known as the "Java not Juvie" Program, 
a program meant to encourage at-risk youth in pursuit of tech careers.  It took years of letters
to the warden, but eventually, Jamie got his big shot: he was granted the opportunity to sit for the entrance exam
to the Java program at a local university.  Jamie knew he had this one chance to leave a life
of crime behind forever, and he wasn't going to take any chances: as soon as he arrived at
the testing facility, he stabbed the proctor and escaped.</p>

<p>A few years later, he wound up at Skill Distillery due to a very lax background-check policy, and has
been here ever since.</p>
