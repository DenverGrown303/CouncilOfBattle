<p>Andrew Conlin was a model in Manhattan before coming to Skill Distillery.  His meteoric rise
shook the fashion world to its core, and was even documented in a movie released several years
later called "Zoolander".  Eventually, it was decided that Andrew was simply too handsome, and that he was making all the other
models look bad.</p>  
<p>So, some strings were pulled, a few no-questions-asked type deals went down,
and next thing you know, Andrew had "graduated" from "college" with a "degree" in "engineering."Soon thereafter, he found himself at Skill Distillery, owing less to his Java acumen and more
to the unlimited access to hot Manhattan parties that he represents.</p>
