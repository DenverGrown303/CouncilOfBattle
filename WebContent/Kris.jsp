<p>Kris Kane was raised by wolves in the mountains, where, as a child, he regularly ate human flesh.  More animal than
man, Kris Kane naturally became the subject of much study by the scientific community.  He was
flown all over the world to attend conference after conference so scientists could marvel
at him as he growled and tried to break free of the cage he was displayed in.  Over the years,
Kris was able to slowly teach himself human communication, and his first words were to ask
his scientist care-takers if he shouldn't be receiving some sort of paycheck for being there with them all the time.  Before he knew it, the scientists had dumped him in a bus station at the edge of town and sped off.</p>

<p>He wandered the streets of that city, shocked by his first glimpse of human civilization.  
His large lumbering frame and hypo-lingual wailing scared everyone all the people near him away.  
While wandering the mean streets, Kris mistook an ATM display reading "HELLO!" for an overture of friendship.  
He decided that day that he would spend the rest of his life searching for a way to
talk to his new computer friend.  Eventually, he was found crawling through the duct system in Skill Distillery and given a job
killing rats.</p>
