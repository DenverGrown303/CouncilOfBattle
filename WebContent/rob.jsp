	<p>Very little is known about Rob Roselius before he burst on the global stage in 1993 with
what was hailed then as the worst rap album of all time.  Titled simply, "Rob Raps",
it mainly featured long database query commands being read aloud with no music
or beat whatsoever.  Pitchfork gave it a 7.9.</p>
<p>Realizing that a rap career perhaps wasn't for him, he decided to pursue his second passion:
database manipulation.  In order, as he says, to "make that paper, son" he teaches at Skill
Distillery, a Java-Development Bootcamp that teaches people how to win a fight in prison.</p>
