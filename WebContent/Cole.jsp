	<p>Cole Frock, born "Susan McMurphy", has enjoyed almost as much success
in the Java Development world as he did at his last job: one of the
entertainers employed at Dandy Dan's, a gentlemen's club in the ghetto.  But eventually,
the "dancer" life got old for Ms. McMurphy, so she decided on a career change.  Along with
other, somewhat more dramatic changes.  Tens of thousands of dollars, and a couple trips to Laos
later, and Mr. Cole Frock was back in the US, ready to start Skill Distillery, a bootcamp
that teaches proper football-throwing techniques.</p>  
<p>Hailing from Texas, Cole has a truck so nice it should, by rights, belong to a wealthy older
woman and claims to know good barbecue.  Of course, as anyone from the real South knows,
you never trust a Texan when it comes to barbecue or a transparent death penalty
appeals process.  Despite being from Texas, Cole can read and has even begun to appreciate the
wisdom behind indoor plumbing.</p>
